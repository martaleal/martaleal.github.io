                  <h3 class="subtitle">Technical Recruiter and Sourcer</h3>
                  <div class="description"><p>Full lifecycle recruiter across a variety of deeply technical roles and grades.</p>
                    <p>Responsibilities:</p>
                    <p>- Come up with and execute creative sourcing strategies so as to meet aggressive hiring goals.
                      These sourcing strategies included but weren't limited to LinkedIn, Entelo, Github, Stack Overflow
                      and boolean sourcing for Google.</p>
                    <p>- Develop and nurture potential leads through IT communities, events, groups, and Meetups.
                      I was constantly in touch with several technical groups in Brazil and South America. </p>
                    <p>- Attend conferences and organize technical and recruitment events. I've extensively traveled all
                      over Brazil and some places in South America collaborating and sometimes leading the organization of
                      events.</p>
                    <p>- Articulate the risks and benefits of a hire alongside with the hiring manager.
                      It has taught me the importance of a solid understanding of business and staffing for a recruiter.</p>
                    <p>- Making sure that we are creating an inclusive sourcing and hiring strategy that takes bold steps to approach people from diverse backgrounds.</p>

                  <h3 class="subtitle ">Recruiting Coordinator</h3>
                  <div class="description"><p>Recruiting coordinator in a complex and solid recruiting process. </p>
                    <p>Responsibilities:</p>
                    <p>- Schedule interviews and feedback huddles with multiple time zones involved.
                      I was the recruiting coordinator responsible for supporting the opening of new offices in Brazil and in Ecuador.</p>
                    <p>- Make sure candidates and colleagues have a great experience with our recruiting process.</p>
                    <p>- Gather feedback from every interview a candidate goes through and make sure our applicant tracking system is up to date with it.
                      During my time with ThoughtWorks I acquired knowledge working with both Greenhouse and Avature.</p>
                    <p>- Conduct phone and face-to-face interviews both in English and Portuguese, as well as applying assessment tests.</p>
                    <p>- Constantly look at our pipeline and suggest approaches to move our candidates through our process faster.
                      I successfully came up with solutions for bottlenecks in our process. Sometimes the right thing to do was to plan a
                      recruitment event, sometimes it'd be speeding up phone screens. It was my job to assure my team was thinking about these
                      solutions.</p>
                    <p>- Multi-task across multiple demands from different stakeholders and prioritizing those effectively.</p></div>
