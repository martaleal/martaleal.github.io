                  <div class="description">
                    <p>I had the pleasure of being the first technical sourcer hired in the North American recruiting team, which enabled me to set the structure of our sourcing process.
During this time with ThoughtWorks, I've been collaborating with a variety of internal stakeholders such as Recruitment Marketing, Recruiters, Technical Consultants, leadership and with recruiting teams in other regions. Key activities:
                    <p>- Amplified candidate leads through alumni groups, LinkedIn, networking, targeted events and Meetups, and research. Sourcing tools included but weren't limited to Entelo, Google X-Ray, GitHub, LinkedIn and Indeed. </p>
                    <p>- Screened prospects and pitched ThoughtWorks as an employer of choice through interesting conversations (over the phone or in person).</p>
                    <p>- Created and executed a strategy to organize and follow-up with qualified leads, which was agreed and shared across the whole team.</p>
                    <p>- Participated in a global sourcing experiment. During three months, together with two other sourcers, we sourced Software Engineers, Heads of Recruiting, Product Specialists across Europe, North America and India. The goal of this experiment was to demonstrate to the business the importance of integrating sourcing as a capability across the recruiting teams globally.</p>
                    <p>- Conducted sourcing trainings to other recruiting teams and for new colleagues.</p>
                    <p>- Working from our San Francisco office, I've always been involved with community events and played a community manager role when necessary.</p>

                  <div class="description"><p>Full lifecycle recruiter across a variety of technical roles and grades. Key activities:</p>
                    <p>- Came up with and executed creative sourcing strategies so as to meet aggressive hiring goals. Always making sure we're creating an inclusive approach able to connect with people from diverse backgrounds.</p>
                    <p>- Developed and nurtured potential leads through IT communities, events, groups, and Meetups.
                      I was constantly in touch with several technical groups in Brazil and South America. </p>
                    <p>- Attended conferences and organized technical and recruitment events. I've extensively traveled all
                      over Brazil and some places in South America collaborating and sometimes leading the organization of
                      events.</p>
                    <p>- Articulated the risks and benefits of a hire alongside with the leadership.
                      It has taught me the importance of a solid understanding of business and staffing for a recruiter.</p>

                  <div class="description"><p>Recruiting coordinator in a complex and solid recruiting process. Responsibilities: </p>
                    <p>- Schedule interviews and debriefs with multiple time zones involved.
                      I was the recruiting coordinator responsible for supporting the opening of new offices in Brazil and in Ecuador.</p>
                    <p>- Make sure candidates and colleagues have a great experience with our recruiting process.</p>
                    <p>- Gather feedback from every interview a candidate goes through and make sure our applicant tracking system is up to date with it.
                      During my time with ThoughtWorks I acquired knowledge working with both Greenhouse and Avature.</p>
                    <p>- Conduct phone and face-to-face interviews both in English and Portuguese, as well as applying assessment tests.</p>
                    <p>- Constantly look at our pipeline and suggest approaches to move our candidates through our process faster.
                      I successfully came up with solutions for bottlenecks in our process. Sometimes the right thing to do was to plan a
                      recruitment event, sometimes it'd be speeding up phone screens. It was my job to assure my team was thinking about these
                      solutions.</p>
                    <p>- Multi-task across multiple demands from different stakeholders and prioritizing those effectively.</p></div>
