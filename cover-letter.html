      <p> Dear DoorDash folks,</p>
      <p>It's with great enthusiasm that I'm applying for the position of Recruiting Coordinator at DoorDash. As a technical recruiting professional, I'm confident that my diverse background and skillset will make a difference in your recruiting team.</p>
      <p>As you can see from my resume, I've built my career helping people and companies to fall in love with each other. And it is a priority for me to make it right.</p>
      <p>During more than 3 years working at ThoughtWorks, I was able to navigate and build a strong knowledge in all the steps of technical recruiting for a multinational company, with aggressive and high standard hiring goals. I first joined the company as a Recruiting Coordinator and was soon working as a full cycle Recruiter. My experience now spans from full cycle technical recruitment to collaborating on strategic plans for building and growing a company, inclusive and diverse employer branding, crafted sourcing initiatives and recruiting events.</p>
      <p>In addition to being adaptable and fast-responsive, I’m also passionate for design – particularly when it comes to ensuring that all recruitment stakeholders are having a great experience with the hiring process. I love to go over an existing process and see if it can be improved in any way.</p>
      <p>As a final thought, I'm thrilled at the possibility of working at DoorDash's recruiting team. I would love to connect and talk about the many ways I believe I can contribute.</p>
      <p>Thank you for taking the time to consider this application and I look forward to hearing from you in the near future!</p>
      <p>Marta Leal</p>
